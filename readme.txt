The only FAQs plugin, that actually answers all questions.

= How do I get the FAQs to show? =

Here are just two steps as a guide, which should be of assistance:
* In your Dashboard, under FAQs you can add the FAQs, which basically just needs a title and content.
* Edit the page you would like to add the FAQs to, right above the content area there is a "Add FAQs" button, which will generate a shortcode based on the settings you choose.

= Can I only show certain links in the banner? =

Yip, we thought of that. Simple leave the text field blank and it will automatically align the remove that specific link and align the rest equally and accordingly.

= Which FontAwesome icons should I use? =

You can find the icons in the [FontAwesome Cheatsheet](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/ "FontAwesome Cheatsheet") and insert only the icon name.

= Can I add any icons? =

Any icons you can find in the [FontAwesome Cheatsheet](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/cheatsheet/ "FontAwesome Cheatsheet"). Also, this plugin will update regularly to include the latest versions of FontAwesome.

= Why does it look so nice in the screenshots and not on my website? =

We have supplied, but a little styling for the simplistic look and that said, every website theme is different so we cannot possibly cater for it all. However, refer to the question below to assist you with styling the layout.

= Can I change the layout or styling? =

You can add custom CSS through your theme, or child theme and it should overwrite the default styling of the layout and icons. To increase or decrease the icons, simply adjust the `font-size` attribute accordingly.

== Screenshots ==
